## Usage

Requires [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) to be installed (you should be able to run <code>convert</code> on the commandline).

    $ folderify examples/octocat/octocat.png
 
- The input file should be an image with a transparent background (i.e. the corners should be transparent).
- folderify will produce a .icns file containing 5 resolutions of folder icons.
  - The .icns file can be assigned as the icon of a file a tool like IconDroplet (another alternative is to assign the icon to an XCode OSX application project and build).
  - The icon can be copied to a folder using the "Get Info" pane in the Finder.
  
## TODO

folderify should become completely automated. Current issues:

- Tweak the settings to approximate the default OSX icons as closely as possible.
- Applying the icon to an actual file: [assignIcon](http://hasseg.org/stuff/assignIconScript/assignIcon.py) or plain Rez/DeRez doesn't seem to work on my Lion installation.
- Fix alginment and clipping.
- Use -clone instead of writing to file.
- Maybe: Handle automatic positive/negative detection, so that the mask doesn't have to be generated by hand.
