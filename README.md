# Try it!

    git clone git://github.com/lgarron/folderify.git
    cd folderify
    for file in examples/src/*.png; do ./folderify $file; done
    open examples/src/

You should see a bunch of new `.icns` files that were automatically generated from the `.png` masks.

Or try this:

    git clone git://github.com/lgarron/folderify.git
    cd folderify
    ./folderify examples/src/folder_outline.png .

The repository folder should now have an icon.

## Usage

Command:

    folderify <image.png> [<optional_target_file_or_folder>]
 
- The input file should be an image with a transparent background. For best results:
  - Use a `.png` file
  - Use a black figure on a transparent background. (Colored images also work, but may produce a weaker effect.)
  - Make sure the corner pixels of the image are transparent. They are currently used for empty margins.
- folderify will produce a `.icns` file containing 5 resolutions of folder icons. The `.icns` file will also have itself as its icon.
  - (Note that normal `.icns` files do NOT have themselves as an icon.)
- The icon can be copied from the generated `.icns` to any other file folder using the "Get Info" pane in the Finder.
  - (Note that this does NOT normally work for `.icns` files, but it does work for such files that have been generated using folderify.)
 
### Dependencies

- [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) - for image processing (you should be able to run <code>convert</code> on the commandline).
- Python 2 - to help assign the icon file to itself.
- Apple Developer Tools (for /Developer/Tools/Rez)

## TODO

- Tweak the settings to approximate the default OSX icons as closely as possible (fix folder shade, mask shade, and bevel settings).
- Allow intermediate files to be generated and combined easily (e.g. to use a different source mask for the smaller icons).
- Use -clone instead of writing to file.
- Maybe: Handle automatic positive/negative detection, so that the mask doesn't have to be generated by hand.
- Allow more procedural image generation (e.g. accept a string as input).
- List of credits and thanks.
